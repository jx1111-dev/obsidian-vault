Matrix and vector multiplication are behind machine/deep learning and computer graphics. What does the GPU do in these actions?

It calculates simple computations, like multiply and sum, where the cpu is not needed.

It does each step independently, which leads to trivial parallelisation.

General purpose GPUs: Computer graphics, Deep Learning, LLMs impossible otherwise.

GPU libraries: Torch, TensorFlow, Open CV...

Matrices are a 2D arrangement of data and variables.
