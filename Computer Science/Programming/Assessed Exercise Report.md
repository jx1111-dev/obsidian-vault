## <u>Task B</u>
To start, I made a flowchart to visualize what I wanted to do in the program. Here, the main 3 functions are defined. The CSV receipt is kept out to simplify the program further. I'm only doing this to set a foundation for me to follow, helping with scope creep and keeping the program modularised.

==REFLECTION==
In terms of learning, I learned a lot from my mistakes of not streamlining my variable names, parameter use in functions, consistent whitespace and commenting. Halfway through the 20 assessed tasks, I realized I needed to comment my code and had to go back and comment every single program, which was a time consuming mistake to make. I also had to rewrite the entirety of task B due to how unreadable and non-linear I made my program. The functions were bouncing off of each other, all their parameters had confusing names, etc. 

In terms of challenges, I had trouble with the bubble sort assessed exercise, the closest_pair_under_budget had me overthinking a lot, while the answer was relatively simple, the is_palindrome exercise was a little difficult if I recall correctly, and I probably got stuck on more that I can't remember due to how long ago I did them.

In terms of improvements, l would say that my code readability and organisation has improved throughout these 20 exercises and task B. I would also say that my logic and troubleshooting skills have gone up spending hours debugging my code. (When I say hours I mean total time spent across all exercises and task B, I didn't spend hours on average per exercise.)
