How to convert from binary to decimal VERY EASILY


   1101

1x2^3, 1x2^2, 0x2^1, 1x2^0

Hex

key fundamentals: used for storing information in memory

used for colours: RRGGBB. Values closer to zero are darker, values closer to 15 (hexadecimal F) are lighter

ASCII

the original character set. contains latin alphabet. it is 7 bit (values 0-128).

ISO/IEC-8859

made to cover other languages. it was 8 bit. Examples:

ISE/IEC 8859-1, western european languages like french or irish
ISE/IEC 8859-5
ISE/IEC 8859-9

UNICODE

32 bit, contains 143859 characters, 154 modern and historic scripts, symbols and emojis. used for all languages\

first 128 characters are ASCII (UTF-8)

Boolean algebra and logic gates

branch of algebra where values are true or false.
main operators are NOT (Negation), AND (Conjunction), and OR (Disjunction).

but why is it used?
this is because of transistors. they can only be on or off, thus the need for boolean algebra.
you can use transistors to make logic gates, which contain the same or more complex operators, like:

NOT (inverter) gate: true when the input is false.
AND gate: true when all inputs are true.
OR gate: true when one input is true
XOR (X stands for exclusive) gate: true when only one input is true.
NXOR gate: true when only one input is false.
NAND (NEGATIVE AND) gate: true when at least one input is false.

NAND and NOR gates can be used to make any other gates.

examples of gates made of other gates:
HALF ADDER gate: adds to binary digits together, outputs the sum, and a carry signal, that indicates an overflow into the next digit

FULL ADDER gate: accounts for values carried in from the previous least significant stage. This is used for adding binary numbers together.
