**Virtualisation** is a process where you create a virtual copy of things such as hardware platforms, storage devices or network resources.

==Types of virtualisation==

**Server virtualisation** is the most common type. It is used to run multiple virtual machines on a single server.

**Desktop virtualisation** is used to run virtual desktops on a single server. This allows users to access their computer from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Application virtualisation** is used to package apps so that they can run on any device without having to be installed. This simplifies software deployment and management.

**Storage virtualisation** is used to pool multiple storage devices together and make them act as a single storage device.

**Network virtualisation** is used to create virtual networks that are isolated from each other. This is useful for security. 

==Why is it good?==
Reduced costs

Increased agility

Improved performance

Increased availability

Simplified management

==Vertical vs horizontal scaling==

**Vertical scaling** is when you add more resources (RAM, CPU, GPU etc.) to a single Virtual Machine instance.

**Horizontal scaling** is when you create more instances of the same size. This is called the **cloud model**.

==Cloud computing==

**Cloud computing** is a model that enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. (think GeForce NOW or Apple Cloud)

==Data-centric security approaches==

Data-centric security is a cyber security that focuses on the security of the files on the cloud at a granular level, regardless of where it is stored or processed. This contrasts traditional security, which protects against access to a system or network.

It is important in the cloud, where files can go between multiple cloud providers and third parties. By protecting their data, organisations can keep control over their data even when its not in their hands.

Some approaches are:

**Data encryption** is the process of scrambling up data using an algorithm that can be reversed using an encryption key. This can be done at rest (when data is stored) or in transit (when data is being transmitted).

**Data access control (DAC)** is the process of restricting access to data in the cloud. It can be implemented through many methods, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

**Data auditing and monitoring** is where any manipulation of data is being recorded, making it easier to identify and stop suspicious activity.

**Data loss prevention (DLP)** solutions help companies prevent sensitive data from being leaked or lost, through monitoring traffic, blocking unauthorised access to data, and encrypting sensitive data.
