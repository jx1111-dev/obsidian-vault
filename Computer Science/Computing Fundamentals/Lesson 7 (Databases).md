==DATABASE TYPES==

**Relational** databases are the defacto and usually the most sought after in jobs because they are "efficient" or whatever (this is what tim said)

**Graph** databases 

**Object-oriented** databases

**NoSQL**  databases

==DATABASE STRUCTURES==

**Files**

**Schemas**

==SOME SQL COMMANDS I GUESS==

To select (think print but databases) data from a database (using SQL), you use the SELECT command and specify the field you want to get data from. 

If, for example, in the table above, you did "SELECT student_id" it would print the entire student_id column. 

WHERE (sort of like an if statement) can be used to specify conditions, like "SELECT student_id WHERE age = 17"

i guess finish this,,, tim put like no effort into this presentation and he explains everything very badly
