**SET: unordered collection of (unique) elements.**

**MULTI-SETS: Unordered collection of any elements.**

**Algebraic sets** are sets but in math. Something like:
$$
S = \{ \varnothing\}
$$
Or:
$$
S = \{ S\in N \land S < 6\} \equiv \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
$$
$$
\in means \space belongs \space to,\equiv means \space equivalent \space (to), \space \land means \space and.
$$
So in this set, S is a set of numbers belonging to N (natural numbers) that are smaller than 6. Thus, you get a set of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
