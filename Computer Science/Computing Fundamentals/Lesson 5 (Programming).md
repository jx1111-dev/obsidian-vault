Paradigm - Fundamental style or approach of programming.

There are lots of paradigms.

__Procedural paradigms__ emphasise a step-by-step approach to problem solving. Here, the program specifies "how" to achieve the desired outcome.

__Imperative paradigms__ are something like Python. Holy moly this makes no sense.

__Object Oriented Programming__ (OOP OMG HE SAID THE THING ITS OOP) is based around the idea of bundling data and the methods (functions) that operate the data into single units called "objects."
This makes it easy to model real life interactions. Encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are key. 

__Event Driven paradigms__ are the concept of responding to events when an action is done by the user e.g. clicking a button. Think GUI. 

__Functional paradigms__ stem from mathematical function theory, it treats computation as the evaluation of math functions without changing data or state.
They promote immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions. Some examples are Haskell or Lisp. They are quintessential functional languages, but modern languages like Java or Python incorporate some functional concepts too.

__Logical/Declarative paradigms___ focus on "what" needs to be done as opposed to "how" it's supposed to be done. Might be pseudocode __*==?==*__

__Concurrent paradigms__ are idk finish this section.
